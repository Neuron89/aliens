MU/TH/UR — Game Mother Terminal (ALIEN RPG)
============================================

A single-file web app for the Game Mother / Dungeon Master:
• Dice roller (Base + Stress dice, optional push, panic detection)
• Cheat sheets (dice rules, difficulty, panic table, skills, combat, stress relief)
• Xenomorph reference (Neomorphs, XX121 Stalker/Scout/Drone, combat rules, critical table)
• Characters & careers (core concepts, game modes, themes)

HOW TO USE
----------
Open index.html in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
No server required — works offline. You can double-click index.html or drag it into a browser window.

OPTIONAL: Copy to your Aliens RPG folder
----------------------------------------
If you have write access to your game folder, copy the entire Aliens-RPG-MUTHUR folder (or just index.html) there, e.g.:
  /mnt/unraid/Tabletop RPGs/Aliens RPG/
Then open index.html from that location if you prefer to keep everything together.
